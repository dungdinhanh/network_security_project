\section{WLAN infrastructure}

\ac{WLAN} does not require wire to connect devices with each others, and it creates connection between devices by deploying an access point device. This access point device can swamp a range of areas of 300feet or 100 meters \cite{gopalakrishnan2014survey}. Furthermore, a group of access point devices can be linked together to provide network services for users within building and between buildings even when users move around.

\subsection{Staion}
\textbf{\ac{STA}}: A wireless endpoint device (client device). \ac{STA}s provide users a tools for gaining access and exploit network resources distributed by network. Computers, smart phones and embedded systems etc.\ are examples of \ac{STA}.

\subsection{Access Point}
\textbf{\ac{AP}}: A device that connects \ac{STA}s with a \ac{DS}, which is often wired network system. A wireless \ac{AP}s would grant access to mobile users when he or she strolls around the building. \ac{AP}s can be linked together to provide a large area access in a building or between buildings.
