\begin{abstract}
	More than one hundred years since the wireless communication was used for the first time, the wireless technology has impressively pervaded human life not only for communication but for the Internet use as well. For a long time, mobile devices use increase has burdened the traditional wire-based local network infrastructure due to its exorbitant escalation. Therefore, a number of companies, corporations and home users are deploying wireless system in local area network due to its mobility and scalability. However, wireless infrastructure raises many security and privacy concerns for business and scientists. As an attacker can catch the information gratuitously as long as he is in the signal range, authentication and data encryption is some of the most prioritized tasks in wireless network. In this report, we generally appraise several secure technologies in wireless local area network such as open shared system, Wired Equivalent Privacy, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol,... and some advanced technologies, which alleviates weaknesses of predecessors.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
