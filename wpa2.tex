\section{Wi-fi Protected Access 2 - WPA2}

\ac{WPA}2 is a security protocol developed by Wi-fi Alliance. It is official released in 2004 by \ac{IEEE}802.11i \cite, \ac{WPA}2 immediately superseded \ac{WPA} in 2006. Up until now, \ac{WPA}2 is extolled to be stable and safe in wireless environment. In comparison with \ac{WEP} and \ac{WPA}, \ac{WPA}2 is a great leap forward of \ac{WLAN} security. First, it uses \ac{AES} encryption algorithm, which is much stronger than\ac{RC4}, to encrypt data. The use of this algorithm provide confidentiality to end users devices or \ac{AP}s. Second, the complexity of \ac{CCMP} makes the brute force attack impossible.
