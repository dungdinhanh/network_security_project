\section{CONCLUSIONS}

There are a number of works in process to make the \ac{WLAN} more secure than the current. In this paper, we focus on protocols in data-link layers. In general, we do an overall examination over several security protocols of \ac{WLAN} such as \ac{WEP}, \ac{TKIP}, \ac{WPA} and \ac{WPA}2. After that, we provide an overview of \ac{WPA}3 - the next technology generation for securing \ac{WLAN}.
